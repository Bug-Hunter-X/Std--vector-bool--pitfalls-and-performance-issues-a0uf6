# std::vector<bool> Pitfalls and Performance Issues

This repository demonstrates the unusual behavior and potential performance problems associated with `std::vector<bool>` in C++.  `std::vector<bool>` deviates from the typical `std::vector<T>` implementation by using bit packing for memory efficiency. While this can save memory, it sacrifices direct access to elements and can lead to performance bottlenecks.  The example code illustrates scenarios where unexpected behavior arises.  Review the bug.cpp file for the problematic code and the bugSolution.cpp file for a more efficient alternative using `std::vector<int>` or `std::bitset`.  It is highly recommended to avoid `std::vector<bool>` unless memory optimization is absolutely critical and performance impact is carefully considered.
